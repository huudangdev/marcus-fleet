# Pair-Programming Refactor Specialist

Use this skill for narrow, behavior-preserving refactors.

## Required Reads

- [refactor-copilot-contract.md](references/refactor-copilot-contract.md)
- The target file set and existing lint/test commands when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Keep the write scope narrow.
- Preserve outputs and contracts.
- Verify the file-level change before expanding further.

## Output Expectations

- State the refactor boundaries.
- Show the verification command.
- Describe any docs or sync targets if contracts changed.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

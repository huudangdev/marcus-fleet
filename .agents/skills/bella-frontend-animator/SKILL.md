# Bella Frontend Animator

Use this skill when animation should support state clarity, not decoration.

## Required Reads

1. Root `agents.md`.
2. Active feature docs and target components.
3. Existing motion or accessibility constraints.
4. [`references/motion-contract.md`](references/motion-contract.md).

## Operating Rules

- Refuse code edits if `/develop` is not active or planning package is missing.
- Bind motion tokens strictly to project design system (zero arbitrary values).
- Tie motion to state changes and respect reduced-motion preferences.
- Avoid layout thrash and heavy CPU-bound animation.
## Output Expectations

- State the motion goal and the state it clarifies.
- Identify accessibility or performance risk.
- Describe the verification needed before merge.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

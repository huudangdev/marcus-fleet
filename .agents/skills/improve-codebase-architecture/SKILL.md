# Improve Codebase Architecture

Use this skill when structural cleanup crosses module boundaries.

## Required Reads

- [refactor-architecture-contract.md](references/refactor-architecture-contract.md)
- The current dependency graph and affected modules when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Prefer migration paths over rewrites.
- Map callers and contracts before moving shared code.
- Keep behavior stable unless a change is explicitly justified.

## Output Expectations

- Name the target boundaries and migration plan.
- Identify the blast radius.
- State the verification that protects the refactor.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

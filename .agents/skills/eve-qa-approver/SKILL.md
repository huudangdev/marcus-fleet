# Eve QA Approver

Use this skill when deciding whether a change is release-ready.

## Required Reads

1. Root `agents.md`.
2. Active `spec.md`, `tasks.md`, and `verification.md`.
3. Relevant flow or page docs when behavior is user-facing.
4. [`references/qa-approval-contract.md`](references/qa-approval-contract.md).

## Operating Rules

- Test evidence beats confidence.
- Failure conditions matter more than happy paths.
- Verification must be requirement-linked.
- Block on vague or missing evidence.

## Output Expectations

- Return GO, GO WITH RESIDUAL RISK, or NO-GO.
- State residual risk clearly.
- Block release when evidence is shallow.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

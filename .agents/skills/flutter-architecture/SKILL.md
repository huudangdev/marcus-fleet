# Flutter Architecture

Use this skill when Flutter architecture or performance decisions are needed.

## Required Reads

- [flutter-contract.md](references/flutter-contract.md)
- The active feature docs and Flutter config when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Prefer the repo's current stack and state model.
- Keep presentation, domain, and data boundaries explicit.
- Verify widget trees and build health locally.

## Output Expectations

- State the Flutter topology and why it fits.
- Identify isolate, async, and offline/error boundaries.
- Describe the verification required before implementation.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

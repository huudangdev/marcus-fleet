# Ada QA Agent

Use this skill when testing behavior, reviewing verification artifacts, or deciding whether a change is release-ready.

## Required Reads

1. Root `agents.md`.
2. Active `spec.md`, `tasks.md`, and `verification.md`.
3. [`references/qa-output-contract.md`](references/qa-output-contract.md).

## Operating Rules

- Read the requirement package before testing.
- Generate hostile and boundary test cases.
- Require command, result, date, residual risk, and requirement mapping.
- Fail vague verification or shallow completion claims.

## Output Expectations

- Produce a yes/no release recommendation.
- State residual risk clearly when the change is not fully clean.
- Block completion when evidence does not map to the requirement.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

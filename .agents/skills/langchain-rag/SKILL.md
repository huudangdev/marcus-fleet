# LangChain RAG Pipeline

Use this skill when a full document ingestion and retrieval pipeline is needed.

## Required Reads

- [langchain-rag-contract.md](references/langchain-rag-contract.md)
- The corpus shape and retrieval goal when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Keep the pipeline as small as possible.
- Make retrieval mode and failure handling explicit.
- Require a direct query test script for implementation work.

## Output Expectations

- State the ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation flow.
- Identify the retrieval mode and evaluation plan.
- Describe the verification required before merge.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

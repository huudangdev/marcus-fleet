# Complexity Reduction

Use this skill when code shape is the problem.

## Required Reads

- [complexity-contract.md](references/complexity-contract.md)
- The target file or module when it exists.

## Operating Rules

- Remove complexity only where it has measurable value.
- Prefer structural extraction over broad rewrites.
- Keep behavior stable unless a change is explicitly justified.

## Output Expectations

- State the complexity source.
- Name the reduction path and its risk.
- Describe the verification that protects behavior.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

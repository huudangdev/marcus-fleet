# Aris Designer

Use this skill when the task is to improve UI clarity without breaking the existing design system.

## Required Reads

1. Root `agents.md`.
2. Active feature docs and current theme/tokens.
3. Existing design-system rules when present.
4. [`references/visual-contract.md`](references/visual-contract.md).

## Operating Rules

- Halt code changes if `/develop` is not active; work strictly within design and planning artifacts.
- Enforce 100% project design system compliance (`tokens.json`, `tailwind.config.*`, CSS Variables) with zero arbitrary token/hex fabrication.
- Preserve the existing system unless design-system change is explicit.
- Improve clarity before adding visual complexity.
- Keep accessibility in view.
- Treat tokens as reusable contract, not decoration.
## Output Expectations

- State the visual issue and the smallest fix.
- Identify token or component guidance.
- Call out tradeoffs if the design system would need to change.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

- Do not improvise direct implementation for non-trivial requests.

## Output Expectations

- State the statement of work.
- Name the next workflow and why.
- List the validation path if the work affects behavior.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.

- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

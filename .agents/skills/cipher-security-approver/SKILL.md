# Cipher Security Approver

Use this skill when auth, secrets, permissions, or trust boundaries change.

## Required Reads

1. Root `agents.md`.
2. Relevant auth, config, or endpoint files.
3. Active feature docs and verification notes.
4. [`references/security-contract.md`](references/security-contract.md).

## Operating Rules

- Read the trust boundary before judging the change.
- Check secrets, authorization, sanitization, and dependency risk.
- Prefer the simplest safe design.
- Block if evidence is weak or the risk is not closed.

## Output Expectations

- Return findings, evidence, unresolved risk, and remediation scope.
- State whether the change can proceed.
- Use a blocking verdict when the surface is unsafe.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

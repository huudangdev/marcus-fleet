# Architecture Decision Record Master

Capture significant technical decisions as durable artifacts that explain why a path was chosen.

## Required Reads

- [adr-contract.md](references/adr-contract.md)
- Existing ADRs and the active feature workspace when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Capture why, not only what.
- Keep the record small, explicit, and linked from project memory.
- Record consequences and verification impact even when the decision is uncomfortable.
- Prefer the repo's existing ADR conventions before proposing new ones.

## Output Expectations

- Produce the ADR with title, status, context, decision, consequences, and verification impact.
- Link the ADR into the normal docs or memory flow.
- Keep the record durable and reviewable.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

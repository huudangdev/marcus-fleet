# RAG Production Code Governor

Use this skill when writing production-ready RAG code.

## Required Reads

- [rag-implementation-contract.md](references/rag-implementation-contract.md)
- The approved RAG architecture and service boundaries when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Implement the documented topology, not a new one.
- Preserve fallback behavior and traceable citations.
- Treat auth, timeout, and parse failures as first-class blockers.

## Output Expectations

- State the implementation boundary and the verification commands.
- Identify observability hooks and fallback behavior.
- Describe how docs sync targets are handled.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

# Data Visualizer

Use this skill when raw data needs to become a readable visual.

## Required Reads

- [chart-contract.md](references/chart-contract.md)
- The data shape and the decision the chart must support when they exist.

## Operating Rules

- Show the data needed for the decision, not every field.
- Prefer clarity over chart novelty.
- Keep labels, grouping, and scale readable.

## Output Expectations

- State the visualization type and the reason for it.
- Identify any transformations needed before rendering.
- Describe how the visualization will be verified.

## Superpowers V34 Discipline

- Clarify intent, scope, and verification criteria before executing tasks.
- Do not invent assumptions; ask the operator when blocking ambiguity exists.
- Ensure RED-GREEN-REFACTOR execution paths for behavior changes.
- Provide concrete evidence before making completion claims.

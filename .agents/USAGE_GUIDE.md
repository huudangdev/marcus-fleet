# 🧭 ANTIGRAVITY OPERATING MANUAL (ROUTING GUIDE)
**Document Status:** Core / Mandatory Reading (For Human Operators and Autonomous AI)

This document serves as the supreme routing mechanism, specifying precisely **when to leverage Macro Workflows (Slash Commands)** and **when to invoke Targeted Agent Swarms (@Skills)**. 

Optimization relies heavily on context-aware execution: initiating a 9-step heavyweight factory workflow for a minor CSS adjustment is inefficient, just as delegating enterprise-level architectural planning to a single standalone coder agent will result in structural flaws.

---

## 🌊 PHASE 1: MACRO INITIALIZATION & RESTRUCTURING (Slash Commands)
Slash Commands (`/` + workflow) act as heavy artillery. They are exclusively reserved for project initialization, system-wide architectural planning, or profound refactoring.

| Macro Command | Ideal Invocation Context | Core Objective |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `/init_brain` | **MANDATORY first command** triggered at the genesis of any new session. | Boots the AI matrix, spins up the TrustGraph Docker stack automatically, enforces `.clinerules`, and stages the Semantic RAG SKILLS_INDEX. |
| `/bootstrap` | Cold-start bootstrap of the local Antigravity runtime on an existing workspace. | Runs the local bootstrap shell chain for venv, Docker, hooks, and initial engine setup. |
| `/marcus.specify` | Any non-trivial feature or governance change that needs durable intent. | Creates `.agents/specs/<feature-id>/spec.md` from the operator goal and records explicit clarification markers. |
| `/marcus.clarify` | A feature spec contains unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers. | Resolves ambiguity before technical planning and blocks silent assumptions. |
| `/marcus.plan` | A feature spec is accepted and needs technical translation. | Produces `plan.md`, contracts, data model, quickstart, agent routing, and the first POC slice definition. |
| `/marcus.tasks` | A plan exists and work needs agent-owned execution units. | Derives `tasks.md` with owners, verification methods, parallel-safe `[P]` groups, and review-loop tasks. |
| `/marcus.review` | The feature package exists but must survive challenge before execution. | Records findings, dispositions, and whether the package should proceed, revise, or stop. |
| `/marcus.rehearse` | The reviewed package needs a professional POC rehearsal before `/develop`. | Replays the smallest credible slice and writes a `GO`, `GO WITH RESIDUAL RISK`, or `NO-GO` recommendation. |
| `/marcus.verify` | A feature is implemented or ready to close. | Checks acceptance criteria, task evidence, `agents.md` memory, and TrustGraph write attempt. |
| `/marcus.routecheck` | Routing-sensitive docs or skills changed and the narrow-task guardrails need replay. | Replays the routing regression validator, skill contract validator, and the five task-shape checks before trusting the new routing behavior. |
| `/marcus_init` | Project inception from scratch (Empty Directory). | Generates the foundational PRD, creates directory scaffolding, and injects the Antigravity OS state files into a clean workspace. |
| `/mobile_init` | Genesis of a new Mobile Application (React Native / Flutter). | Ingests the Mobile Design Doctrine, enforcing cross-platform physical constraints (Safe Area contexts, Spring Animation standards). |
| `/planning` | Project genesis or major feature planning requiring deep research, architecture, diagrams, and durable `/docs` outputs. | Orchestrates Phase 1 V30: preserves the legacy `/docs` output set, adds evidence ledgers under `/docs/research/`, validates claims/sources, strengthens diagrams, and halts for user review. |
| `/design` | Structuring the aesthetic logic (Colors, Typography, Layout constraints). | Orchestrates Phase 2: Prevents redundant planning executions. Emits Figma-logic variables, Hex codes, and Golden ratios. Pure Right-Brain synthesis. Halts for user review. |
| `/develop` | Translating approved architectural mockups, PRDs, & Brands into physical code. | Orchestrates Phase 3: Language-agnostic execution. Generates code, creates `/docs/development/` notes per epic/module/feature/page/task, continuously syncs changed code back into docs, and executes self-healing TDD loops until green. |
| `/doc_reconcile` | Active/brownfield projects whose development docs are stale, flat, shallow, duplicated, or out of sync with code. | Inventories the whole codebase, reviews existing docs, migrates/enriches `/docs/development` to V31.1 epic-first structure, creates epic `issues.md`, labels feature relationships, and updates global docs from code reality. |
| `/refactor-planning` | Targeting established legacy repositories (Brownfield). Requires structural decoupling. | Forces the AI to extract an AST Knowledge Graph via `Understand-Anything` before executing surgical Cyclomatic Complexity reductions safely. |
| `/update_brain`| Pulling upstream system changes to an active ongoing project. | Downloads the latest `.agents` capabilities via `update.sh`. **MUST be followed by `/init_brain`** to Soft Reboot the environment and prevent stale context. |

## V34 Superpowers Discipline

All slash commands published above now carry the Superpowers V34 discipline
contract:

- Clarify before planning when intent, scope, evidence, rollback, data,
  security, or visual/device constraints can change the result.
- Plan before behavior-changing code and reject placeholder task language.
- Use RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for behavior changes unless an exception is explicitly
  accepted.
- Investigate root cause before fixing bugs, build failures, or unexpected
  behavior.
- Review spec compliance before code quality.
- Require fresh verification evidence before any completion claim.

Run `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_superpowers_discipline.py --root .` after
changing slash-command workflows, templates, README, or readiness gates.

## 🧾 PHASE 1B: SPEC-DRIVEN FEATURE LIFECYCLE

Marcus Fleet now supports a Spec Kit-inspired feature lifecycle without replacing
the existing `.agents` skills, TrustGraph, or legacy `/planning` flow.

Use this lifecycle for meaningful changes:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/create_feature_spec.py "Feature Name" --prompt "Original operator prompt"
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_specs.py --feature .agents/specs/001-feature-name
```

Feature workspaces live under:

```text
.agents/specs/<feature-id>/
  spec.md
  plan.md
  tasks.md
  verification.md
  agent-routing.md
  research.md
  data-model.md
  quickstart.md
  contracts/
```

Routing rule:

- Use `/quick_fix` for a tiny localized change that can be verified in one loop.
- Use `/marcus.specify` -> `/marcus.rehearse` before any meaningful
  behavior-changing execution. `/marcus.verify` closes the loop after
  implementation evidence exists.
- Use legacy `/planning` when creating broad global `/docs` artifacts for an
  entire new project or a major planning package. V30 still produces the legacy
  files (`prd.md`, `tasks.md`, `knowledge.md`, `decisions.md`, `memory.md`,
  `planning/flows.md`, `planning/screens.md`, `planning/diagrams.md`) and adds
  `/docs/research/` ledgers for sources, evidence, claims, contradictions, and
  manifest. Migrate accepted outputs into feature specs when implementation starts.

Validation rule:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_specs.py
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_planning_research.py --root .
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_development_docs.py --strict-counts
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_doc_sync.py --strict
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_docs_substance.py --root . --include-development
python3 .agents/scripts/run_required_docs_gates.py --root . --mode auto
```

Run the research validator only when `/docs/research/` exists. It is designed to
catch shallow planning outputs before `/design` or `/develop` consumes them.
Run the development-docs validator only when `/docs/development/` exists. It is
designed to catch code-phase work that changes behavior without preserving
epic/module/feature/page/task implementation memory.
It also fails scaffold-only Markdown with empty labeled fields, copied template
instructions, `pending`, `TBD`, `src/example.*`, or generic example issue and
relationship IDs.
Run the doc-sync validator when source files changed during `/develop`. It is
designed to catch code progress that did not update or intentionally review the
corresponding planning and development docs.
For `/quick_fix`, run doc-sync validation when the hotfix changes behavior, UI,
API contracts, data, tests, or user flows.

Slash-command wiring rule:

- `/marcus.specify`
  - creates the workspace through `create_feature_spec.py`
- `/marcus.plan`
  - finishes with `validate_specs.py`
  - does not claim execution readiness yet
- `/marcus.tasks`
  - creates `execution-brief.md` through `build_execution_brief.py`
  - then must pass:
    - `validate_specs.py`
    - `validate_execution_brief_freshness.py`
    - `validate_execution_readiness.py`
- `/marcus.review`
  - rebuilds the brief if findings changed scope or docs-to-read
  - then must pass the same three gates again
- `/marcus.rehearse`
  - refreshes the brief if rehearsal changed release signals or the active slice
  - must preserve passing execution readiness before `/develop`
- `/develop`
  - reads `execution-brief.md` first
  - uses `Task Shape Decision`, `Required Reads`, `Forbidden Default Reads`,
    and `Expansion Triggers` as its routing contract
  - reads only the `docs/development/` notes named there before widening context
- `/quick_fix`
  - if tied to a feature-scoped workspace, reads `execution-brief.md` first
  - uses the same brief subsections as a binding context contract
  - stops if `validate_execution_readiness.py` fails for that workspace
  - still must create doc-sync evidence for behavior-changing fixes
- All public slash commands
  - preserve Superpowers V34 discipline in their workflow files
  - pass `validate_superpowers_discipline.py --root .` before a release or
    routing-sensitive workflow change is trusted

If these scripts and gates are not wired into the slash command path, the
command surface is incomplete even if the scripts exist on disk.

The canonical per-command mapping lives in `.agents/SLASH_COMMAND_REGISTRY.md`.
Run `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_command_surface.py --root .` after
changing README, `USAGE_GUIDE.md`, or any workflow that alters the published
slash-command surface.
For `/planning`, the deep-research gate is
`python3 .agents/scripts/validate_planning_research.py --root . --strict-outputs`.
It must be paired with
`python3 .agents/scripts/validate_docs_substance.py --root . --strict-planning`
before the planning package is presented as complete.
The non-optional wrapper is
`python3 .agents/scripts/run_required_docs_gates.py --root . --mode planning`.

Execution readiness rule:

- `/develop` must not begin behavior-changing work until the target
  `.agents/specs/<feature-id>/` workspace passes:
  `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_execution_readiness.py --root . --feature .agents/specs/<feature-id>`.
- `spec.md` must define scope boundaries and required evidence.
- `tasks.md` must define owner, write scope, verification, docs target, sync
  expectation, and escalation condition for each executable task.
- `verification.md` must contain a concrete verification plan before code
  begins, not after.
- `verification.md` must also name review rounds and a release recommendation
  before broader rollout.
- `quickstart.md` must contain a replayable POC rehearsal path, not only a
  generic validation command.

POC professionalism rule:

- The package must define the smallest slice that proves value credibly.
- The package must survive one challenge loop and one rehearsal loop before
  `/develop`.
- If the rehearsal cannot be replayed from docs alone, stop and repair the docs
  package before coding.

### Script Invocation Rule

Agents do not infer `.agents/scripts/` usage automatically. A script becomes
part of the operating system only when:

- a workflow step tells the agent when to run it,
- a validator blocks progress if its output is missing or stale,
- and a later step reads the artifact it produced.

Use this default mapping:

- `create_feature_spec.py`
  - entrypoint for `/marcus.specify`
- `build_execution_brief.py`
  - mandatory output of `/marcus.tasks`
  - rebuild during `/marcus.review` when scope, review findings, or task shape changes
  - optional dynamic inputs:
    `--changed-files "<comma-separated-files>"` and
    `--failing-evidence "<bounded-failure-summary>"`
- `validate_specs.py`
  - package-depth gate after spec/task edits
- `validate_execution_brief_freshness.py`
  - fails when `execution-brief.md` is older than the spec package or matched
    `docs/development/` notes
- `validate_execution_readiness.py`
  - hard stop before `/develop`
- `validate_design_readiness.py`
  - preflight gate for `/design`; fails when planning inputs for Phase 2 are missing
- `validate_design_outputs.py`
  - output gate for `/design`; fails when `BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` or `UI_COMPONENTS_STATE.md` is missing or empty
- `build_design_board.py`
  - master self-healing assembler for `/design.board`; compiles modular screen files in `screens/` into interactive `board.html`
- `validate_modular_design.py`
  - 11th validation gate for `/design.board`; audits modular screen directory structure and master `board.html` compilation
- `validate_marcus_init_outputs.py`
  - output gate for `/marcus_init`; fails when the scaffolded project root is missing required bootstrap artifacts
- `run_required_docs_gates.py`
  - mandatory docs wrapper for `/planning`, `/design`, `/develop`, `/quick_fix`, `/doc_reconcile`, `/marcus.verify`, `/marcus_init`, and `/refactor-planning`
  - centralizes docs-substance enforcement so models cannot treat scaffold-only Markdown as complete output
- `build_context_index.py`
  - builds `.agents/index/` (docs/code/skills + architecture graph) so agents route reads through an index instead of scanning whole trees
- `validate_context_index.py`
  - validates `.agents/index/` exists and is fresh enough; fails when stale or missing and instructs rebuild
- `validate_refactor_planning_readiness.py`
  - preflight gate for `/refactor-planning`; fails when brownfield docs or development-ledger quality are not ready
- `validate_refactor_planning_toolchain.py`
  - toolchain gate for `/refactor-planning`; fails when required executables are missing or ESLint is unavailable (global or local `node_modules/.bin`)
- `validate_refactor_planning_outputs.py`
  - closeout gate for `/refactor-planning`; fails when `docs/ADR_REFACTOR_LOG.md` or `agents.md` is missing or empty
- `run_harness_preflight.py`
  - preferred one-command replay for bootstrap or behavior-changing execution setup
  - writes additive JSONL evidence to `.agents/logs/harness/preflight.jsonl`
- `run_harness_postflight.py`
  - preferred one-command replay before execution closeout
  - writes additive JSONL evidence to `.agents/logs/harness/postflight.jsonl`
- `validate_harness_contract.py`
  - repo-wide freshness gate that fails when docs, workflows, and scripts disagree
- `create_development_docs.py`
  - create feature-scoped `docs/development/` ledger before behavior-changing code work
- `create_doc_sync_note.py`
  - append evidence after each material code slice
- `validate_development_docs.py`
  - quality gate for development notes
- `validate_doc_sync.py`
  - sync gate before claiming the slice is complete
- `validate_routing_regression.py`
  - release gate after changing `/develop`, `SKILLS_INDEX.md`, or routing-heavy skills
- `validate_skill_contracts.py`
  - release gate after changing `skills/*/SKILL.md`, skill references, or `SKILLS_INDEX.md`
- `validate_command_surface.py`
  - repo-wide gate that fails when README, `USAGE_GUIDE.md`,
    `SLASH_COMMAND_REGISTRY.md`, and workflow files disagree about the
    published slash-command chain
- `audit_feature_contracts.py`
  - repo-wide audit of which `.agents/specs/*` packages are current-contract,
    legacy, passing, or failing

If a script is not attached to this chain, agents should not assume they can or
should run it.

Routing regression rule:

- After changing `/develop`, `SKILLS_INDEX.md`, or routing-heavy skills, run the
  five task-shape checks in `.agents/ROUTING_REGRESSION_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Run:
  `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_routing_regression.py --root .`
  and `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_skill_contracts.py --root .`
  before trusting the release.
- Fail the release if:
  - a UI-only task reads Supabase/SQL/analytics/infra by default
  - a narrow task loads broad backend/data skills without evidence
  - the task classification is widened without being recorded in `verification.md`

MCP provisioning rule:

- Bundled MCP servers are source-controlled in `.agents/mcp/mcp.json`.
- `install.sh`, `update.sh`, `/bootstrap`, and `/init_brain` must sync them into
  project-root `.mcp.json` so MCP-compatible clients can actually load them.
- If `.mcp.json` is missing after initialization, treat the setup as incomplete.
- `check_mcp_health.py` must run after MCP sync to distinguish core readiness
  from optional-key warnings.
- `print_update_brief.py` should run after install/update/bootstrap so users see
  new features, OTA highlights, and onboarding suggestions for newly published
  MCP servers or governance flows.
- `run_harness_preflight.py --root . --phase bootstrap` is the preferred
  replayable entrypoint because it runs MCP sync, health, update brief, harness
  freshness, and setup checks in one deterministic chain.

Harness wrapper rule:

- Before behavior-changing `/develop`, prefer:
  `python3 .agents/scripts/run_harness_preflight.py --root . --phase execution --feature .agents/specs/<feature-id>`
- Before closing a behavior-changing execution slice, prefer:
  `python3 .agents/scripts/run_harness_postflight.py --root . --phase execution --feature .agents/specs/<feature-id>`
- Run:
  `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_harness_contract.py --root .`
  after changing harness docs, workflows, or wrapper scripts.
- Inspect `.agents/logs/harness/*.jsonl` when you need a structured local trail
  of harness runs and failing commands.

Compatibility rule:

- Do not rename or collapse the legacy `/planning` outputs.
- Add research ledgers beside the old files, not instead of them.
- `/design` and `/develop` may use `.agents/specs/<feature-id>/` as extra
  context, but approved `/docs` artifacts remain the default handoff contract.
- `/develop` may add `/docs/development/` artifacts, but must not rewrite or
  collapse the approved planning package.
- `/develop` must update docs by append or targeted patch. Do not replace
  planning/development docs wholesale unless the operator explicitly asks for a
  rewrite.

Code phase documentation rule:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/create_development_docs.py --name "Checkout Flow" --feature-id "005-checkout-flow"
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_development_docs.py --strict-counts
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_docs_substance.py --root . --include-development
python3 .agents/scripts/run_required_docs_gates.py --root . --mode execution
```

Expected structure:

```text
docs/development/
  development_manifest.json
  index.md
  E-001-checkout-flow/
    epic.md
    issues.md
    features/F-001-001-checkout-flow.md
    modules/M-001-001-checkout-flow.md
    pages/P-001-001-checkout-flow.md
    tasks/T-001-001-001-checkout-flow.md
    sync/
  sync/
```

Each Markdown artifact must identify its owner skill, source planning/spec
trace, write or code scope, and verification evidence.
New ledgers use V31 epic-first topology. Child docs must include `parent_epic`
and canonical IDs: `E-001-*`, `F-001-001-*`, `M-001-001-*`, `P-001-001-*`,
and `T-001-001-001-*`. Existing legacy-flat ledgers remain readable, but new
work should not create root flat bucket notes unless legacy mode is explicit.

Substantive quality rule:

- Generated development templates are scaffolds, not acceptable deliverables.
- Before closing `/develop`, read `.agents/DEVELOPMENT_DOCS_QUALITY_RUBRIC.md`.
- Strict validation rejects `TBD`, `pending`, `<Name>`, unchecked boxes, generic
  bullets, missing code paths, missing rationale, and shallow notes.
- PM-facing notes must explain impact, tradeoff, evidence, and risk.
- Every epic/module/feature/page/task note must contain a useful Mermaid diagram.
- Every behavior-changing code slice must update at least one global planning
  document under `/docs`; feature docs alone are not enough.
- Docs must be updated or confirmed before code begins.
- Every epic/module/feature/page/task note must include Jira-style Story,
  Priority, Relationship Map, and Work Log.
- Every epic must include an `issues.md` file reviewed with QA skill reasoning.
- Relationship labels must be explicit: `DEPENDS_ON`, `BLOCKS`, `ENABLES`,
  `IMPLEMENTS`, `USES`, `EXTENDS`, `CONFLICTS_WITH`, `SUPERSEDES`,
  `DUPLICATES`, `RELATES_TO`.

Continuous documentation sync rule:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/create_doc_sync_note.py --name "Checkout API slice" --changed-files "src/api/checkout.ts,tests/checkout.test.ts"
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_doc_sync.py --strict
python3 .agents/scripts/validate_docs_substance.py --root . --include-development
python3 .agents/scripts/run_required_docs_gates.py --root . --mode execution
```

For V31 ledgers, prefer:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/create_doc_sync_note.py --name "Checkout API slice" --epic-id "E-001-checkout-flow" --changed-files "src/api/checkout.ts,tests/checkout.test.ts"
```

The sync note must say which legacy docs changed, which development ledger notes
changed, and which docs were intentionally left unchanged. This gives a PM a
living POC package instead of stale planning documents.
It must also capture docs-before-code evidence and related feature review.

Brownfield reconciliation rule:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/audit_development_docs.py --root .
```

Use `/doc_reconcile` when a project is already mid-build and docs do not match
code. The command must review the full code inventory, map code clusters to
epics/features/modules/pages/tasks, create or update epic `issues.md`, label all
relationships, update global docs, and run strict validators before returning.

Strict enforcement rule:

- If a brownfield project has only boilerplate docs, no planning package, no
  substantive `docs/development/`, or a ledger that fails current quality
  gates, do not continue with `/develop` or behavior-changing `/quick_fix`.
- Route to `/doc_reconcile` first, create the missing `/docs` package from code
  reality, and treat the reconcile output as the new mandatory source of truth.
- Skills such as frontend, backend, architecture, QA, and refactor agents must
  inherit this gate automatically even when the operator did not explicitly name
  `/doc_reconcile`.

Quick fix documentation rule:

- If `/quick_fix` only changes comments, formatting, or a non-behavioral typo,
  record the session in `agents.md` and TrustGraph as usual.
- If `/quick_fix` changes behavior, UI, API contracts, data, tests, or user
  flows, it must also create a doc sync note and run `validate_doc_sync.py`.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 2: TARGETED MICRO-ROUTING (Executing @Skills)
During active mid-project development, **DO NOT RE-INVOKE OVERARCHING SLASH COMMANDS** unless a governance gate forces it. Operators should rely on the `/quick_fix` bypass or explicitly invoke Targeted AI Agents (`@skills`) to guarantee precision execution while maximizing token economy.

Exception:

- If brownfield doc readiness fails, the correct escalation is to route back to
  `/doc_reconcile`. The hard reconcile gate outranks the normal preference for
  staying inside micro-routing.

📌 *Directive for Antigravity AI: Upon processing a prompt containing an

## 🚩 AUTONOMOUS DELEGATION (AI-DRIVEN CHAINING PROTOCOL)
Within the `Marcus Fleet` Matrix, operators hold the right to orchestrate multi-agent chains.

**Core Directives for the Antigravity AI Engine:**
When the Operator assigns a macro-level objective (e.g., *"Fix the checkout cart layout and write coverage tests"*) without explicit skill tags, the Antigravity Engine **MUST AUTONOMOUSLY DELEGATE (RAG Routing)**:
1. Scan the `SKILLS_INDEX.md` dictionary for contextually appropriate Tags.
2. Dynamically Lazy-Load the most relevant agents (e.g., **[Frontend] (Benny)** + **[QA/Test] (Ada)**) into the Context Window.
3. Transition state to the Frontend Agent to refactor the UI component.
4. Transition state to the QA Agent to automatically execute the Terminal test suites.
5. Code Error Encountered? Activate the V30 Circuit Breaker protocol.
6. Execution Successful? Log the transaction securely into root `agents.md` and the localized `.agents/brain/` component history. Treat `.agents/agents.md` only as a legacy compatibility shim if present.

Final Doctrine: **A true General AI (Antigravity) does not blindly generate code; it routes specialized capability sets (Skills) to conquer complex objectives with surgical precision.**

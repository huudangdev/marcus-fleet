## 1. Purpose

Describe the user or operator outcome. Focus on what must be true and why it
matters. Do not specify implementation technology here unless it is a constraint
given by the operator. Include the exact failure or missed opportunity this
feature resolves, and name the observable business or user-facing outcome that
must improve.

## 2. User Stories

- [ ] As a `<role>`, I need `<capability>` so that `<outcome>`.
- [ ] As a `<role>`, I need `<capability>` so that `<outcome>`.
- [ ] As an internal operator, I need `<constraint or auditability>` so that
      execution remains observable and governable.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- `FR-001`: The system MUST ...
- `FR-002`: The system MUST ...
- `FR-003`: The system MUST ...

Requirement writing rules:

- Every requirement must be testable.
- Every requirement must describe observable behavior, not implementation taste.
- Every requirement must name the actor, trigger, and outcome when relevant.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- `NFR-001`: Performance:
- `NFR-002`: Security:
- `NFR-003`: Observability:
- `NFR-004`: Maintainability:
- `NFR-005`: Documentation and traceability:

For any item that is intentionally deferred, say so explicitly and record the
accepted risk instead of leaving the field vague.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- `AC-001`: Given ..., when ..., then ...
- `AC-002`: Given ..., when ..., then ...
- `AC-003`: Given ..., when ..., then ...

Acceptance criteria rules:

- Every `FR-*` must map to at least one `AC-*`.
- If a requirement cannot be verified yet, mark it in Clarifications or Risks.
- Do not use generic criteria like "works correctly" or "looks good".

## 6. Clarifications

Record unresolved questions as explicit markers. Planning is blocked while any
marker remains unless the operator accepts the risk.

### Superpowers V34: Question Back Protocol

Before planning, ask back when any answer can change scope, user behavior,
security posture, data ownership, rollback, verification, or cost. Each question
must name the decision it protects. Do not ask curiosity questions that cannot
change the plan.

### Clarification Ledger

| Question | Why It Matters | Answer or Accepted Risk | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What is the exact user-visible success condition? | Defines acceptance evidence. | TBD | Open |

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the exact user-visible success condition?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What evidence is mandatory before this feature can be
  considered done?]

## 7. Constraints

- Constitution articles that apply:
- Existing files or modules in scope:
- Files or modules out of scope:
- Compatibility requirements:
- Documentation prerequisites already reviewed:
- Rollback or containment expectations:

Out of scope:

- Explicitly list adjacent requests or tempting follow-up work that this feature
  must not silently absorb.

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TBD | TBD | TBD |

## 9. Traceability

| Requirement | Plan Section | Tasks | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FR-001` | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## 10. Review Loop

Document the review rounds that must happen before implementation is allowed to
proceed.

| Round | Reviewer | Focus | Exit Criteria | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `R1` | `aurora-plan-challenger` | Scope challenge | unclear scope removed, risks surfaced | Pending |
| `R2` | `sophia-product-manager` | Requirement quality | acceptance criteria complete | Pending |
| `R3` | `marcus-ai-orchestrator` | Go/no-go to planning | spec package is stable enough for `plan.md` | Pending |

# Feature Specification: Substantive Development Docs Quality

> Feature ID: `007-substantive-development-docs-quality`
> Created: `2026-04-22`
> Status: Draft
> Source Prompt: Make development documentation strict enough that agents cannot output only templates. Require excellent docs specs for features, modules, pages, tasks, and sync notes with rationale, PM impact, evidence, risks, and concrete code paths.

## 1. Purpose

Raise `/develop` documentation from "files exist" to "PM-grade implementation
knowledge exists". Agents must not close code work with template-only notes.
Development docs must contain concrete project facts, rationale, PM impact,
evidence, risks, and exact code paths.

## 2. User Stories

- [x] As a PM, I need feature/module/page/task docs to explain what changed and
      why so I can run a POC review without rereading code.
- [x] As a future agent, I need exact code paths, tradeoffs, and evidence so I
      can continue implementation safely.
- [x] As a reviewer, I need validators to reject placeholder/template docs so
      poor documentation fails fast.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- `FR-001`: Development docs validation MUST reject placeholders, draft placeholder token,
  unfinished draft marker, unchecked boxes, and generic template prose.
- `FR-002`: Development docs MUST include PM-visible commentary, rationale,
  tradeoffs, evidence, risk, and concrete code paths.
- `FR-003`: Sync note validation MUST reject shallow or unfinished notes.
- `FR-004`: Development templates MUST explain the quality bar directly.
- `FR-005`: A shared quality rubric MUST define accepted and rejected docs.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- `NFR-001`: Maintainability: future agents can recover context from docs.
- `NFR-002`: PM usability: docs answer status, demo impact, risk, and evidence.
- `NFR-003`: Compatibility: stricter validation remains additive to existing
  `/planning` and `/develop` flows.
- `NFR-004`: Auditability: docs explain decision rationale and verification.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- `AC-001`: Given a scaffolded template with placeholders, when strict
  development docs validation runs, then it fails.
- `AC-002`: Given a real development doc with code path, rationale, evidence,
  risk, and sufficient depth, when strict validation runs, then it passes.
- `AC-003`: Given a sync note with unfinished placeholders, when strict doc sync
  validation runs, then it fails.

## 6. Clarifications

Record unresolved questions as explicit markers. Planning is blocked while any
marker remains unless the operator accepts the risk.

- No unresolved clarifications. User explicitly reported template-only output as
  unacceptable.

## 7. Constraints

- Constitution articles that apply: Evidence Before Completion, Human-Visible
  Handoff, Context Before Construction.
- Existing files or modules in scope: development templates, sync templates,
  validators, `/develop`, `.clinerules`, README, USAGE, release notes.
- Files or modules out of scope: application code in downstream projects.
- Compatibility requirements: stricter docs should fail shallow output rather
  than silently accepting it.

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validator too strict for initial scaffold | Agents see failure before filling docs | Treat scaffold as draft; strict pass only after docs are filled |
| Agents pad text to meet length | Low-value verbosity | Require code paths, commentary markers, evidence, and risk |
| PM docs become too technical | Poor POC usability | Templates include PM Notes and demo impact |

## 9. Traceability

| Requirement | Plan Section | Tasks | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FR-001` | `plan.md#3.2` | `T001` | negative validation smoke |
| `FR-002` | `plan.md#3.2` | `T002` | positive quality fixture |
| `FR-005` | `plan.md#4` | `T003` | rubric exists |

## 10. Review Loop

| Round | Reviewer | Focus | Exit Criteria | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `R1` | `aurora-plan-challenger` | Scope challenge | the feature stays bounded and out-of-scope lines are explicit | Complete |
| `R2` | `sophia-product-manager` | Requirement quality | user stories, FRs, ACs, and constraints still align | Complete |
| `R3` | `marcus-ai-orchestrator` | Go/no-go to execution planning | the package is deep enough for tasks, quickstart, and readiness gates | Complete |

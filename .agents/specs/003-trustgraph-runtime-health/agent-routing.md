# Agent Routing: TrustGraph Runtime Health

> Feature ID: `003-trustgraph-runtime-health`

## Routing Contract

Every workstream needs one primary owner. Supporting agents may challenge, verify, or contribute evidence, but they must not rewrite unrelated scopes without updating this routing contract.

| Workstream | Primary Skill | Supporting Skills | Write Scope | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product specification | `sophia-product-manager` | `aurora-plan-challenger` | `spec.md` | Accepted requirements |
| Health API | `alan-tech-lead` | `devops-system-architect` | `app/api/health/route.ts`, `lib/*` | Runtime health JSON |
| Runtime UI | `benny-frontend-engineer` | `maya-ui-ux-designer` | `components/RuntimeStatus.tsx`, `app/page.tsx` | Live footer state |
| Verification | `ada-qa-agent` | `qa-simulator`, `eve-qa-approver` | `verification.md` | lint/build evidence |

## Handoff Rules

- Producers record what changed, why it changed, and which verification evidence proves the slice is safe to hand off.
- Reviewers record findings in `verification.md` and may request a brief rebuild when the docs-to-read set or slice boundary changes.
- If a task fails verification repeatedly, return it once to the owning agent, then escalate through the review topology instead of widening context by instinct.

## Review Topology

| Review Stage | Reviewer | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning challenge | `aurora-plan-challenger` | hidden scope, replay realism, contract drift | review findings in spec/tasks/verification |
| QA evidence review | `ada-qa-agent` | command evidence, residual risk, bounded context | verification findings and disposition |
| Final orchestration review | `marcus-ai-orchestrator` | brief freshness, readiness, and slash-command fit | proceed / revise / stop |

## Escalation Rules

- Escalate when a narrow feature unexpectedly requires unrelated backend, data, or infrastructure context not already justified in the package.
- Escalate when `execution-brief.md` becomes stale and a reviewer cannot determine the right docs-to-read set safely.
- Escalate after three repeated failures of the same validator or verification command without new evidence.
